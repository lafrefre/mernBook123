        <p>
            I am a full-stack web developer with a background in EMS. I am passionate about creating user-friendly and
            responsive websites and applications. I am a lifelong learner and
            enjoy the challenge of learning new things. I am
            currently working on a full-stack project using React, Node, Express,
            and MongoDB. I am excited to continue to grow as a developer and to work on
            projects that will make a positive impact on the world.
