# React Portfolio

## Overview

This is a non-functional React application created as part of a learning process. The purpose of this repository is to showcase the structure of a React portfolio. Please note that, at the current state, the application does not have any functional features, and it's a work in progress.

## Notice

‚ö†Ô∏è **This Application is Non-Functional**: As of now, the React portfolio is a placeholder and does not have any working features. This is part of the learning journey, and updates will be made as I continue to explore and learn React.

## Future Updates

üöß **Work in Progress**: The application will be updated and revised as I gain more experience with React. Future updates will include functional components, improved styling, and additional features to make this a fully operational portfolio.

## Getting Started

As of now, there is no need to set up or run this application since it's not functional. However, feel free to explore the code structure and file organization to get an idea of how a React portfolio might be structured.
